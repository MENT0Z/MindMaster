## Features

- **Upload Study Materials**: Users can upload documents, presentations, and other educational resources to the platform.
- **AI-Based Emotion Recognition**: Using advanced computer vision techniques, Mind Master analyzes the user's facial expressions through the webcam during study sessions.
- **Dynamic Content Adjustment**: The AI adjusts the presented content in real-time, modifying the complexity, format, or focus based on detected emotions .
- **Enhanced Learning Experience**: Personalized content suggestions help keep the user motivated, focused, and better able to understand complex materials.
  
## How It Works

1. **Upload Content**: Users upload their study material (PDF, PPT, etc.) to the portal.
2. **Emotion Detection**: While the user studies, the AI uses the webcam feed to continuously monitor their facial expressions.
3. **Content Analysis**: The AI analyzes the uploaded study materials and breaks them down into manageable sections or key points.
4. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Based on the detected emotional cues, the platform adjusts the content, offering simplified explanations, deeper insights, or alternative formats (e.g., visual aids, summaries).
